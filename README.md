# cowo-Sass
a simple SASS Library

This project is a simple SASS Library of things that I tend to re-use between web development projects. 
It's my 1st Github repo, so I'll use this repo to learn how this all works.

The project contains: 
1 html file (index.html) 
1 css file (global.css) that is compiled from several partial sass files, which are obviously also included in the repo.
